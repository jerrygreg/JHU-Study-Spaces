How this works: Run GetAllCourses, then run MapGenerator to create an HTML file to find when classrooms do not have classes in them.

NOTE: This can not show when PILOTs, clubs, exams, or any other occasion has a room booked for reasons other than a regularly scheduled class.

TODO: 
- UPDATE & FINISH THE README
- WORK ON MAKING THE HTML FILE MORE CLEAR WITH LABELS AND INSTRUCTIONS
- MAKE A VISUAL MAP TO NAVIGATE FINDING SPACES
