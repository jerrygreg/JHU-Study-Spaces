## How this works: 
Run GetAllCourses, then run MapGenerator to create an HTML file to find when classrooms do not have classes in them. The MapGenerator.html has an example of what this will look like. 

# FEATURES:
- Allows filtering based on building, room #, day of the week, class name, professor name, time.
- Allows to search only for rooms with a minimum amount of time open. E.g. It will not display a room open for 5 minutes if you want a minimum of 10 minutes.

# NOTE: 
This can not show when PILOTs, clubs, exams, or any other occasion has a room booked for reasons other than a regularly scheduled class.

# TODO: 
- UPDATE & FINISH THE README
- WORK ON MAKING THE HTML FILE MORE CLEAR WITH LABELS AND INSTRUCTIONS
- MAKE A VISUAL MAP TO NAVIGATE FINDING SPACES
